RAFT是用于光流估计的工作
### Optical flows
Optical flow is the pattern of apprent motion of objects, surfaces, and edges in a visual scene caused by the relative motion between an observer and a scene. Optical flow can also be defined as the distribution of apparent velocities of movement of brightness pattern in an image.

My understanding: optical flow describes the motion of pixels.
